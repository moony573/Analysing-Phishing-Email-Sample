Chapter 1: Executive Summary
1.1 Objective of the Report
The purpose of this report is to conduct a comprehensive technical and behavioural analysis of a suspicious job offer email suspected to be part of a phishing or scam campaign. The analysis was conducted as part of a real-world cybersecurity learning exercise aimed at improving threat identification, validation, and response reporting skills.
This report presents findings in a professional, structured format aligned with standard security analysis practices. It aims to educate users about how scammers exploit free platforms (like Gmail and Freelancer.com) and bypass traditional spam filters using personalized yet deceptive messages.

1.2 Overview of Tools and Methods
To assess the legitimacy of the email and uncover potential threats, the following tools and techniques were used:
* Email Header Analysis using tools like Google Admin Toolbox to extract routing paths, timestamps, and authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) data.
* WHOIS Lookup to investigate the registration and ownership of the sending IP address and domain.
* Manual Language & Tone Analysis to identify signs of social engineering such as urgency, reward baiting, or impersonation.
* Reverse DNS Resolution & IP Reputation Checks to validate whether the sending IP address is owned by a reputable organization.
* Link Hover & Verification to check whether the email attempts redirection to unverified platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, external job sites).
Each tool helped verify a distinct component of the email's origin, technical legitimacy, or intent.

1.3 Original Email Sample
Below is the full content of the suspicious email that was analysed. This email is shown strictly for cybersecurity awareness and education.

Disclaimer: The above email content is shown solely for academic and security training purposes. Information has been partially masked to prevent misuse.

1.4 Summary of Key Findings
The analysis of the email revealed the following key observations:
* SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Passed: The email was genuinely sent through Gmail's authorized infrastructure (mail-sor-f41.google.com) using the IP address 209.85.220.41, a legitimate Google mail server.
* Suspicious Use of Free Gmail Domain: The sender used a generic Gmail account (scriptentryteam1@gmail.com) rather than a domain-matching business email, which is common in phishing campaigns.
* Bulk Recipient Behaviour: The email was sent to more than 18 recipients simultaneously-suggesting mass mailing with a generic message.
* Unusual Call-to-Action: The message encouraged users to bypass email by contacting a phone number on WhatsApp, a platform where phishing and scams are harder to trace.
* No Organizational Identity or Verification: The email lacked clear company credentials, digital signatures, or verification details-raising doubts about its authenticity.

1.5 Outcome and Conclusion
The email was technically authenticated, meaning it passed SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks, and was relayed through valid Google infrastructure. However, technical legitimacy does not guarantee sender identity trustworthiness.
Upon behavioural and contextual analysis, the email shows strong indicators of a scam or phishing attempt:
* Mass-targeting approach,
* Free and unverifiable Gmail address,
* Redirect to WhatsApp with no vetting,
* No job details, no credentials, and no verification.
Therefore, the email is classified as a social engineering-based scam or phishing attempt designed to exploit trust and manipulate freelancers into off-platform interaction, potentially for fraudulent purposes.
Through this task, we gain deeper insight into:
* The importance of cross-verifying authenticated emails,
* How scammers leverage legitimate infrastructure,
* Why analysing sender behaviour is as critical as technical validation.
This exercise sharpens the ability to dissect phishing campaigns and educates on how to protect oneself and others from similar threats.








Chapter 2: Introduction
2.1 Background on Phishing
Phishing is a form of cybercrime that uses deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, banking details, or other personal data. It is one of the most prevalent and successful forms of social engineering, targeting users' trust and exploiting human behaviour rather than technical vulnerabilities.
These attacks often impersonate trusted organizations, such as banks, service providers, or government agencies, to lure recipients into clicking malicious links or downloading harmful attachments. Phishing emails can also serve as the entry point for more advanced attacks like ransomware deployment, identity theft, or unauthorized access to critical systems.
With the increasing sophistication of phishing techniques, including spear-phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and clone phishing, individuals and organizations alike must remain vigilant and proactive in identifying and reporting such threats.

2.2 Purpose and Scope of the Task
This task involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of a suspicious email, with the purpose of identifying and documenting the characteristics that qualify it as a phishing attempt. The analysis includes evaluating the technical structure of the email (headers, sender address, authentication), the content (tone, grammar, intent), and any embedded resources (links, attachments).
The scope of the report includes:
* Verification of the sender's identity and domain.
* Inspection of the email header for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results.
* Evaluation of hyperlinks and file attachments.
* Analysis of the language and tone used in the message.
* Identification of phishing traits and formulation of key takeaways.
This task aligns with the broader goal of enhancing email security awareness and applying defensive cybersecurity techniques in real-world scenarios.

2.3 Importance of Email Threat Analysis
Email remains the most common vector for cyberattacks, with phishing accounting for over 90% of data breaches globally, according to numerous security reports. Despite advances in spam filters and email security gateways, attackers continually evolve their tactics to bypass automated detection mechanisms.
Therefore, the ability to manually analyse and interpret the indicators of phishing is an essential skill for students, IT professionals, and any digital user. Email threat analysis empowers individuals to:
* Recognize phishing attempts that may evade filters.
* Understand how attackers structure and deliver deceptive messages.
* Make informed decisions when handling suspicious communications.
* Contribute to collective organizational security through proper incident reporting.
This report demonstrates how a single email can be reverse-engineered to uncover a broader phishing campaign and highlights the need for layered defences and user training in cybersecurity best practices.






Chapter 3: Tools and Methodology
3.1 Tools Used
In this investigation, a combination of freely available, industry-trusted tools and manual inspection methods were used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a suspicious email. The tools chosen enabled both technical dissection and behavioural assessment of the message, helping to identify signs of phishing or social engineering. Below is an overview of the tools utilized during the analysis:
3.1.1 Email Client 
The email was accessed through a widely-used web-based email client that provides a "Show Original" or similar feature to view raw email headers. This feature was used to extract the full message header, which includes detailed metadata such as the sending IP address, authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and routing paths.
3.1.2 Message Header Analyzer Tool
The extracted header was analysed using an online message header analyser tool. This tool provides a graphical timeline of the email's delivery path and verifies:
* SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Whether the sending IP was authorized by the domain.
* DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Whether the email content was signed and verified.
* DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance): Whether the domain owner's policy was enforced correctly.
* IP trace route and delivery delays: Identifying the originating servers and detecting any unusual routing patterns.
3.1.3 WHOIS Lookup
The sending IP address was queried using public WHOIS lookup services. These tools revealed ownership and registration details of the IP, helping determine whether it belonged to a reputable organization. The findings confirmed that the IP was registered to a major cloud/email service provider, supporting the technical legitimacy of the sending server, while raising concerns about the sender's use of a free domain.
3.1.4 Manual Link Inspection and Behaviour Analysis
Although the email did not contain embedded hyperlinks or attachments, the body text requested contact via a third-party messaging app, a common redirection tactic used by scammers. The message was assessed manually for:
* Psychological manipulation (urgency, trust exploitation)
* Unverified contact methods (personal phone numbers instead of corporate emails)
* Absence of official links or company verification methods
This type of inspection is critical in identifying phishing attempts that rely on social engineering rather than malware.
3.1.5 VirusTotal and Other Online Scanners (not triggered in this case)
Although not required in this case (due to lack of file or URL attachments), VirusTotal and URLVoid were prepared to be used in case of:
* Suspicious URLs
* Attachments with high-risk file types (e.g., .exe, .zip, .html, .pdf)
* Embedded scripts or malware
These tools allow for safe scanning without executing potentially dangerous files.

3.2 Methodology and Step-by-Step Approach
A structured, investigative workflow was followed to ensure consistency and objectivity during analysis. The steps were:
Step 1: Header Extraction
* The full email header was accessed using the email client's built-in tool.
* The header was copied and analysed using an online message header tool.
Step 2: Sender and Domain Verification
* The "From" field was reviewed, and the sender's domain was extracted.
* WHOIS queries were run on the originating IP to check ownership and hosting details.
Step 3: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Evaluation
* Authentication results were interpreted using the header analyser.
* All results passed, confirming the message was sent through legitimate mail infrastructure.
Step 4: Content and Language Analysis
* The email body was reviewed for tone, intent, and language quality.
* Red flags such as lack of job details, generic greetings, and urgency to move to a messaging app were noted.
* The sender's name appeared informal and unverified.
Step 5: Recipient Behaviour and Pattern Recognition
* The message was sent to a large number of recipients-indicating a bulk phishing attempt.
* This pattern mimics scam campaigns targeting multiple individuals with identical content.
Step 6: Evidence Documentation
* All findings (headers, screenshots, domain/IP ownership, and metadata) were documented and categorized.
* Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) were listed in a structured manner to support the final classification.

3.3 Ethical Considerations and Data Handling
The analysis was conducted in a controlled, educational environment, ensuring no interaction with the sender, no clicking on links, and no exposure to possible malicious payloads. Sensitive recipient data has been anonymized or excluded from any public documentation.

3.4 Relevance of Methodology to Real-World Scenarios
This investigation simulated an entry-level cybersecurity triage workflow. The tools and steps used mirror those employed by incident responders, email security analysts, and SOC (Security Operations Centre) personnel. Mastery of this methodology is essential for professionals tasked with identifying and mitigating email-based threats in enterprise environments.





Chapter 4: Email Sample Description
4.1 Overview of the Email
The email selected for analysis was received from the address scriptentryteam1@gmail.com on July 29, 2025, at 4:55 PM IST, bearing the subject line "Data entry work." The message was directed to over 18 visible recipients, all listed in the "To" field, which indicates that it was likely part of a mass-mailing effort.
The sender introduced themselves informally as Muskan Sharma, stating that they had reviewed the recipient's freelancer profile and were seeking data entry operators. The message instructed recipients to contact the sender on WhatsApp and submit a screenshot of their freelancer profile to initiate further discussion.
This type of unsolicited job offer, sent from a free email domain with a vague message body and an off-platform redirection (to WhatsApp), is commonly observed in phishing and scam campaigns targeting freelance professionals.

The language is informal, generic, and devoid of any professional signature or organization affiliation. There are no specific job details, no reference to the recipient's name or profile, and no contractual or identity verification information.

4.4 Red Flags and Suspicious Indicators
IndicatorDescriptionUse of a Free Gmail AddressLegitimate companies typically send emails from domain-specific accounts, not personal Gmail IDs.Bulk DistributionAll recipients are listed openly in the "To" field, suggesting the email was not personalized.Unverified Contact MethodThe sender instructs the recipient to contact via WhatsApp, a common tactic to avoid traceability.Lack of Company BrandingNo organization name, website, or contact details are included.Absence of Job DetailsNo information regarding role responsibilities, compensation, or application process.Informal Tone and StructureThe message lacks professionalism and includes vague wording.These characteristics are consistent with phishing and scam tactics that seek to exploit freelance job seekers and redirect them into private communication channels where fraudulent interactions may occur.

4.5 Email Header Analysis
The email header was examined using a secure header analysis tool. The extracted metadata confirmed the following:
Header FieldValue / ObservationMessage IDMasked for privacySending IP AddressRedacted (Belonged to a major email provider)Sending HostRedacted (Authorized provider infrastructure)SPF AuthenticationPassDKIM AuthenticationPassDMARC PolicyPassDelivery DelayWithin normal rangeNote : Full header details are withheld here to preserve privacy and infrastructure security. Authentication results confirm the email was sent via a legitimate service, but this does not validate the intent or identity of the sender.

4.6 IP and Domain Ownership Verification
The IP address associated with the email was verified using WHOIS lookup services. The results (sanitized here) showed:
AttributeValue (Redacted for Public Sharing)IP OrganizationLarge US-based internet company (name omitted)NetRangeRedactedASNRedactedLocationRedactedDomain RegistrationRegistered since early 2000sReverse DNSRedacted (host associated with email infrastructure)These results confirm that email infrastructure was legitimate, but highlight that free accounts from such providers can be exploited by attackers.

4.7 Interpretation
Despite passing all technical validation checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), the email exhibits strong behavioural red flags:
* Informal tone,
* Bulk targeting,
* Off-platform communication,
* Lack of verification or professional details.
This message aligns with known freelance scam patterns, relying on human manipulation rather than malware or attachments. The goal is to move the recipient into a private, less-regulated channel where fraud may occur. This case underscores the need to evaluate context and content, not just technical authenticity.




Chapter 5: Detailed Analysis
5.1 Sender Verification
5.1.1 Display Name vs. Actual Email Address
* Display Name: Script Entry
* Email Address: scriptentryteam1@gmail.com
The sender used a free Gmail address rather than a domain-based corporate email (e.g., @companyname.com). While Gmail's infrastructure is technically secure and authenticated, using a generic address for job offers is considered suspicious. Legitimate organizations typically use verified domains and email signatures for recruitment communications.
5.1.2 Domain Authentication and Ownership
* Domain Ownership: Not applicable (free email service)
* SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Pass
* DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Pass
* DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance): Pass
* Mailed-by / Signed-by: gmail.com
These email authentication results confirm technical legitimacy, indicating the message came from an authorized Gmail server. However, authentication protocols do not validate the sender's trustworthiness or business legitimacy.

5.2 Header and Distribution Pattern Analysis
Analysis of the email header revealed:
* Recipient Exposure: The message was sent to at least 18 addresses, all openly visible in the "To" field.
* Privacy Concern: This violates email etiquette and exposes recipient data.
* Bulk Behaviour Pattern: No personalization or BCC usage, which is typical of phishing or scam campaigns.
Legitimate recruiters maintain individual communication channels and prioritize recipient confidentiality.

5.3 Content Analysis
5.3.1 Language and Tone
The body of the email is brief, informal, and non-specific. Example:
"We saw your freelancer profile. We're looking for data entry operators. Contact us on WhatsApp with your freelancer screenshot."
Key Observations:
* No personalization: Recipient name, profile reference, or location missing.
* Grammatical issues: Sentence structure is basic and lacks professionalism.
* Non-professional redirection: The request to move to Third-Party Messaging App for further discussion is unorthodox and suspect.
5.3.2 Omission of Key Job Information
The email omits essential components of a professional job offer, such as:
* Job title and responsibilities
* Employer name or website
* Salary or compensation details
* Official contact person or HR designation
* Application, interview, or onboarding procedure
* Email signature or disclaimers
These omissions are common indicators of fraud attempts that prioritize quick engagement over transparency.
5.3.3 Psychological Triggers and Manipulation Techniques
* Curiosity and Opportunity: Appeals to freelancers seeking work.
* Urgency via minimal barriers: No formal process; simply message on WhatsApp.
* Deceptive Simplicity: The message appears harmless and casual-intended to bypass critical thinking.
These are classic social engineering methods targeting emotional and opportunistic triggers rather than technical vulnerabilities.

5.4 Link and Attachment Evaluation
5.4.1 Hyperlink and Redirection Behaviour
* No clickable links were present.
* Instead, a plain-text phone number was shared:
+91 XXXXX XXXXX
* Recipients were directed to Third-Party Messaging App for follow-up.
This method:
* Avoids spam filters (which scan for malicious links)
* Moves the conversation off-platform, where:
o Logs are harder to capture
o Fraud is more difficult to track
o Victims are more susceptible to manipulation
5.4.2 Attachment Behaviour
* No attachments were included in the original email.
* However, phishing campaigns using WhatsApp often continue with:
o Suspicious file requests (.apk, .zip, .exe, etc.)
o Requests for personal documentation (IDs, photos, banking info)
o Demands for "processing" or "registration" fees
Thus, the email acts as a gateway to higher-risk interactions once off-platform.

5.5 Conclusion
Summary Table of Risk Indicators
Suspicious TraitImplicationUse of a free email accountNo organizational verification or sender accountabilityMass distribution to open listResembles impersonal spam/scam campaignsLack of job structure/detailsNo transparency or formal engagement processRedirection to WhatsAppAvoids traceability; increases risk of fraudInformal and vague languageReduces credibility; mirrors known scam language patternsRisk Level: High
The evaluation of this email-its sender behaviour, content structure, and engagement method-clearly indicates it is a phishing or scam attempt. While the message is technically valid in terms of infrastructure, its behavioural and contextual markers reveal a deceptive intent.
This analysis highlights how non-technical cues, when assessed alongside message headers and server details, can help detect socially engineered attacks, even when no malware or links are used.



Chapter 6: Summary of Findings
6.1 Tabulated Indicators of Phishing
The following table consolidates all observable indicators that collectively classify the analysed email as a phishing or scam attempt. Each component was evaluated on its credibility, transparency, and alignment with professional standards.

Chapter 8: Conclusion
8.1 Conclusion
The analysis conducted in this case study confirms that the email titled "Data entry work", sent from a free email service provider and requesting off-platform engagement, exhibits multiple red flags indicative of a phishing or scam attempt. Although the message did not contain hyperlinks or file attachments, its content, distribution method, and tone align with tactics frequently seen in social engineering campaigns.
One of the key insights from this investigation is that even technically authenticated emails-those passing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks-can still be deceptive. This email exploited behavioural loopholes such as urgency, informality, and emotional triggers while cleverly avoiding traditional spam filters by redirecting users to an unregulated messaging platform.
Using freely available investigation tools (such as email header analysers, WHOIS lookup services, and manual inspection), we dissected the email structure, verified technical legitimacy, and evaluated its intent through contextual cues. The process reaffirmed that behavioural analysis is as critical as technical validation in identifying phishing attempts.

8.2 Key Learnings
Learning AreaInsight GainedEmail Structure AnalysisFull headers can reveal hidden delivery patterns and sender information.Authentication ProtocolsSPF, DKIM, and DMARC success doesn't equate to sender legitimacy.Content EvaluationPoor grammar, informal tone, and generic phrasing are strong phishing indicators.Social Engineering TacticsScammers exploit trust by moving conversations to apps like messaging platforms.Tool UsageFree tools like Google Admin Toolbox, WHOIS, and VirusTotal offer strong support.
8.3 Final Thoughts
In today's digital environment, email remains one of the most exploited attack vectors, particularly in phishing campaigns. This analysis demonstrates that phishing attacks don't always involve malware or complex code-they rely on manipulating human behaviour.
To mitigate such threats, it's essential to:
* Be skeptical of unsolicited job offers that lack clear details or organizational validation.
* Verify sender identity and communication channels before engaging.
* Use available tools to analyse email headers and content.
* Promote awareness by reporting incidents and educating peers.
This exercise not only sharpens practical cybersecurity skills but also promotes a proactive and vigilant digital culture. Whether for personal safety or professional defense, identifying low-observability threats is a foundational skill in today's cybersecurity landscape.
